# Product Overview

A platform where people can place digital items for bidding. They can put an object up for bidding, and share the page publicly for viewing and purchasing.

### Key Features
- **Bidding Mechanism:** If the winner ghosts, the offer rolls down to the 2nd highest bidder and so on. The winner doesn't see the bidding list until the bidding time is complete.
- **Contact and Verification:** Email-based contact; users need to verify their email first. Anyone can view the public bid page, but to bid, bidders must create an account and verify their email.
- **Role as Intermediary:** The platform serves as an intermediary to connect the two parties. It does not handle payments or transactions; users carry out deals on their own.
- **Interface Design:** The interface should be minimal, usable, and fully serve its purpose.
